This is just a fun side-project to see if a chatbot-esque game master AI (for tabletop games like D&D) can create a believable world and world interactions, using mostly a semantic network for the AI.

This is *not* production code, it's a first-pass prototype, and as such it needs a lot of refactoring. It's just a proof of concept.
